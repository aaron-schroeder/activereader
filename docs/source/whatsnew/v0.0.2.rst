.. _whatsnew_002.enhancements.route_files:

Reading route files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

ActivityElement creation methods :meth:`Tcx.from_file<activereader.tcx.Tcx.from_file>` and 
:meth:`Gpx.from_file<activereader.gpx.Gpx.from_file>` can now read route files in addition 
to activity files. Previously, these methods were not reading in the data properly
from these files, which are formatted slightly differently than activity files. 
The failure was quiet: the list of trackpoints would simply be empty, for example.

.. _whatsnew_002.enhancements.xml_reader:

Create :mod:`~activereader.base.XmlReader`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A common class that is used by :meth:`Tcx.from_file<activereader.tcx.Tcx.from_file>` and 
:meth:`Gpx.from_file<activereader.gpx.Gpx.from_file>`.
